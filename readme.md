# The Demiurge

### About
This is a multi-purpose Discord bot that helps facilitate online games of Invisible Sun. Built using the Discord.js Node package, The Demiurge allows players to perform various useful automated tasks using Discord's Slash Command architecture. </p>

### Disclaimer
Monte Cook Games does not allow the sharing or reprinting of their content for any purpose, which is a policy this bot takes seriously! If you don't have access to the digital version of the Black Cube, the Demiurge will mostly be a very complicated dice-rolling bot. Which is fine, obviously, if that's what you're into.

### Commands

#### /roll
Rolls a 10-sided die. If multiple dice are rolled at once, all results after the first are bolded to signify that they are magical effects and subject to magical flux.

#### /sooth
Draws a sooth card by scraping the Invisible Sun website. Note: you will need your own login credentials for this to work!

#### /incant
Draws a random incantation from the incantation deck. Incantations drawn are moved to the incants discard folder so they can't be drawn again until the deck is refreshed.

#### /ephemera
Draws a random ephemera item from the ephemera deck. Ephemera drawn are moved to the ephemera discard folder so they can't be drawn again until the deck is refreshed.
