      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This is a multi-purpose Discord bot that helps facilitate online games of Invisible Sun. Built using the Discord.js Node package, The Demiurge allows players to perform various useful automated tasks using Discord's Slash Command architecture. </p>

    <section id = "disclaimer">
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Monte Cook Games does not allow the sharing or reprinting of their content for any purpose, which is a policy this bot takes seriously! If you don't have access to the digital version of the Black Cube, the Demiurge will mostly be a very complicated dice-rolling bot. Which is fine, obviously, if that's what you're into.</p>

    <section id="setup">
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Config-</b> create a file in the main directory called "config.json". In this you'll need to put your server token, guild ID, and client ID.</li>
        <li><b>Discord-</b> invite the demiurge to your server and configure its permissions.</li>
        <li><b>IMGs-</b> again, if all you want is a fancy dice roller you can skip this step. If you don't, you'll want the digital versions of all the cards in Invisible Sun. Snip them so that each is an individual png (googling "invisible sun individual cards" should bring you to the guide I used) and place them in the appropriate directories (i.e., ephemera go in the "ephemera" directory, incantations go in the "incant" directory. You get it).</li>
        <li><b>Node-</b> you're running this using Node.js, so make sure you're familiar with using the Node Package Manager. Once everything's imported and all your setup is done, just run</li>
      </ol>

    <section id="dice">
      <h2>Dice Rolls</h2>
      <h3>/roll</h3>
      <p>Rolls a 10-sided die. Optional parameters allow the user to specify how many dice to roll ("number") and a modifier ("venture") to add to the roll. All rolls after the first are in bold.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sooth">
      <h2>Sooth Cards</h2>
      <h3>/sooth</h3>
      <p>Scrapes the Inviisble Sun website for sooth card information including family, value, and a general description.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="incant">
      <h2>Incantations</h2>
      <h3>/incant</h3>
      <p>Draws a random incantation from the incantation deck. Incantations drawn are moved to the incants discard folder so they can't be drawn again until the deck is refreshed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <a href="refresh">
        <h2>Refresh</h2>
        <p>Run refresh.js in the command line in order to return all discarded cards back to their appropriate decks.</p>
