      <h2>About</h2>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Monte Cook Games does not allow the sharing or reprinting of their content for any purpose, which is a policy this bot takes seriously! If you don't have access to the digital version of the Black Cube, the Demiurge will mostly be a very complicated dice-rolling bot. Which is fine, obviously, if that's what you're into.</p>
